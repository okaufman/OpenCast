# Audio canvas plugin (paella-core >= 1.1)

It is used to play streams containing audio only. This canvas is designed to work together with the [audio-only stream plugin](audio_video_plugin.md).

This canvas is used to place the preview image defined in the metadata section of the [video manifest](video_manifest.md), which is a required data. If the video manifest does not contain this data, an exception will be thrown.
