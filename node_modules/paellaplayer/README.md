Paella Player (up to release 6.x)

The Paella (pronounced 'paeja') Player is an HTML 5 multistream player, developed by the [Universitat Politècnica de València](https://www.upv.es/).
It is specially designed for lecture recordings, like [Opencast](https://opencast.org) lectures or Polimedia pills.

Paella Player is capable of playing multiple audio and video streams synchronously and can be integrated into almost any video platform
using its powerful and easy to use plugin architecture.
